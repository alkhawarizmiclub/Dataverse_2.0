# Dataverse 2.0
Here you can find our work during the Dataverse 2.0 competition that was hosted by ENSA Khouribga during the 20th and 21st of November 2023.

There are 2 branches :
- [`main`](https://github.com/alkhawarizmiclub/Dataverse_2.0/tree/main) which contains the final version we used during the competition.
- [`enhanced`](https://github.com/alkhawarizmiclub/Dataverse_2.0/tree/enhanced) which contains an updated version of the `main` that we made later where we added another training dataset and used feature engineering at the data processing phase.
